 * \section intro_sec Library overview
 *
 * Libbuteosyncml implements Open Mobile Alliance Data Synchronization protocol
 * (OMA DS), formerly known as SyncML. This library offers:
 * - Support for OMA DS 1.1.2 and 1.2.1
 * - Both OMA DS Client and Server functionality
 * - Bindings for HTTP and OBEX
 * - WbXML support using libwbxml2

 * \page whatis What is libbuteosyncml?
 *  Libbuteosyncml is a protocol stack that implements OMA DS standard. It is based
 *  on Qt and provides easy-to-use and easy-to-understand interface for synchronizing
 *  data between devices and services.
 *
 *  It should be noted libbuteosyncml it is not a complete synchronization solution,
 *  because in addition to the protocol stack, a total solution would include at least:
 * - Integration to storage backends. Libbuteosyncml has been designed to be
 *   generic enough to allow synchronization of practically any kind of data
 *   ranging from simple PIM data to large files. It does not understand anything
 *   about the data it is synchronizing; this is the responsibility of 'storage
 *   plugins' which are written by the developers interested in synchronizing some
 *   specific data type, for example contacts.
 * - Detection of changes in a storage. SyncML protocol supports fast synchronization
 *   that is achieved by sending only modifications occurred in a storage since last
 *   synchronization session, instead of exchanging all the items. Implementation of
 *   this detection of changes (additions, modifications and deletion of items) is
 *   the responsibility of developers writing the 'storage plugins'.
 * - User interface. Libbuteosyncml includes Qt signals that provide information about
 *   an ongoing synchronization sessions, but it is the responsibility of the developers
 *   to act on these signals.
 *
 * \page howtouse How to use it
 *
 * Synchronization session is governed by SyncAgent. SyncAgent support two types of
 * operation:
 * - Initiating a synchronization towards another device or service
 * - Responding to synchronization request sent by another device or service
 *
 * SyncAgent must be configured by passing a SyncAgentConfig object to it. SyncAgentConfig
 * includes a number of parameters and properties that can be used to specify what should
 * be synchronized and how. These parameters and properties can be configured run-time,
 * or by specifying an XML file that corresponds to the defined configuration schema.
 *
 * The most critical configuration parameters include:
 *
 * - Storage provider. Developers using libbuteosyncml must implement StorageProvider
 *   interface that SyncAgent uses to query storage backends when required. These storage
 *   backends are abstracted by StoragePlugin interface, which developers also must implement
 *   for each type of data they wish to synchronize. Libbuteosyncml does not provide readymade
 *   StoragePlugin implementations, as these are highly dependant on the underlying storage
 *   backend.
 * - Transport. Libbuteosyncml includes readymade transport for HTTP. For OBEX, SyncML bindings
 *   are provided. Users must provide an implementation for OBEXConnection interface to
 *   to use whatever transport layer is wanted ( for example Bluetooth, USB, IrDA, etc ). Creation
 *   of totally custom transports is also supported, they can be implemented by inheriting from
 *   Transport interface (or from BaseTransport abstract class that includes WbXML support).
 * - Location of database. Libbuteosyncml maintains an SQL database that includes SyncML sync
 *   anchors, item ID mappings, MD5 nonces and suspend/resume information. By default this
 *   database is placed to /etc/sync/, but is highly recommended that synchronization applications
 *   specify their own location for this database.
 * - Information necessary to initiate a synchronization. For example in order to initiate a synchronization,
 *   information is required what storage backends should be synchronized, should authentication
 *   be used (and if so, which authentication scheme to use) and what protocol version to use.
 *
 * SyncAgent must be run in a thread that has an event loop. Synchronization is started by calling
 * either startSync() or listen(), after which status updates concerning the state of the
 * synchronization session can be received with signals stateChanged() and itemProcessed(). When
 * synchronization session is finished, syncFinished() signal is emitted and results of the
 * synchronization can be retrieved with getResults().
 *
 *
 * \page creatingstorageplugin Creating a storage plugin
 *
 * Developers using libbuteosyncml must implement StorageProvider callback interface. This interface is
 * used by SyncAgent to reserve and release storage backends, based on either storage database URI or MIME type.
 * Individual storage backends are abstracted by StoragePlugin interface. This interface includes all the necessary
 * callback functions that SyncAgent needs to synchronize the database. This involves functionality related
 * to the following topics:
 *
 * - Metadata of the storage. SyncAgent must be able to access for example the source database URI, the list of
 *   supported MIME types, maximum supported item size and SyncML CTCaps of the storage.
 * - Accessing storage items. SyncAgent must be able to access individual items of a storage backend. These items
 *   are called 'sync items' that are represented by SyncItem class. Each 'sync item' is identified with a unique
 *   ID that is reinforced by the StoragePlugin.
 * - Manipulation of storage items. The purpose of SyncML is synchronization, and this is achieved by adding new
 *   items to a storage backend, and/or by modifying and deleting existing items of the storage backend.
 * - Sync analysis. In order to achieve fast synchronization, StoragePlugin implementations must be able to analyze
 *   changes that have occurred in the storage backend since last synchronization.

/*! \brief SyncAgent is the base API for using the synchronization library

 *
 * SyncAgent entity which provides the interface for synchronization to the
 * application. It creates the synchronization thread for a specific connection
 * and fills up data the the protocol handler.
 *
 * As per Qt's Documentation on <a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/4.5/threads.html#qobject-reentrancy">Threads</a>, "The child of a QObject must always be
 * created in the thread where the parent was created. This implies, among other
 * things, that you should never pass the QThread object (this) as the parent of
 * an object created in the thread (since the QThread object itself was created
 * in another thread)." So, all actions pertaining to SyncAgent should be done
 * in one single thread. If the Agent is created in one thread and subsequent
 * commands are issued in another thread, Qt's parent child relationship between
 * multiple threads prevents the Signals to be emitted to parents in another thread.
 *
 * The behavior for "Issuing the same command twice" is unsupported and undefined.
